# Meeting Room-API
Sample Meeting Room schedule management built with Java and Angular

## Goals
The main goals of this project were to practice backend and frontend development and integration.

The backend was developed in Java with Spring Boot.

The frontend was developed with Angular.

## Technologies

 + Java 11+
 + Spring Boot 2.4.1
 + Angular 9.0.0-rc.7
 + JQuery
 + Bootstrap

## Testing

Ir order to test this application, it's recommended to have an IDE installed on the machine.

Clone the repository.

Run the backend server, on port 8080.

Run the frontend on port 4200. To start the frontend development server, just run the following command, on the frontend root folder:

`ng serve`

The application uses H2 In Memory database, so every time the backend is restarted, all the rooms are lost.
